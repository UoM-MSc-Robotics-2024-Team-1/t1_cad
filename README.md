# t1_cad

## Description

This repository contains 3D CAD models designed as part of the `t1_cad` project. These models are intended for use in engineering, design, and educational projects. The CAD files are compatible with SolidWorks, a leading CAD software for 3D design and engineering.

## Installation

To use these CAD files, follow the steps below:

1. **Download the Whole Folder**: Navigate to the main page of this repository and download the entire `t1_cad` folder to your local machine.

2. **Software Requirement**: Ensure you have SolidWorks installed on your computer to open and edit the CAD files. These files are specifically designed for compatibility with SolidWorks and may not function correctly with other CAD software.

## Viewing 3D CAD Screenshots

For quick reference and visualization, screenshots of the 3D CAD models are available in the `screenprint` folder. This allows you to view the design without the need for opening the files in SolidWorks.

## Usage

After downloading the files and ensuring you have the necessary software, you can open the CAD files in SolidWorks to view, edit, or use them as part of your project. These models can serve as a basis for engineering designs, educational projects, or any other applications that require 3D CAD models.

## Contributing

Contributions to the `t1_cad` project are welcome. Whether it's enhancing the existing CAD models, adding new models, or improving the documentation, your contributions are appreciated. Please submit your contributions via pull requests.
